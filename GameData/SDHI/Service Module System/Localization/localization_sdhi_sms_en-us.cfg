		#autoLOC_SDHI_Boost_Protect_Cover_partName = SDHI Mk1-3 Pod Boost Protection Cover
		#autoLOC_SDHI_Boost_Protect_Cover_partDescription = A jettisonable aerodynamic cowling for Kerlington's Mk1-3 Command Pod, offering ample protection against both Escape Tower debris and avian fecal matter. For best results, use in conjunction with the SDHI Clamp-O-Tron Docking Port with Parachute and SDHI Launch Abort System.

		#autoLOC_SDHI_LAS_partName = SDHI Launch Abort System
		#autoLOC_SDHI_LAS_partDescription = A fast-burning solid fuel rocket booster assembly mounted at the top of the Boost Protective Cover, designed to quickly pull the Mk1-3 Pod away from the rest of the lifter rocket in an emergency. Comes with a separate jettison motor to separate the BPC from the Pod, as well as a built-in solid fuel-powered RCS steering motor for better control of the jettisoned pod's trajectory.

		#autoLOC_SDHI_ParaDock_partName = SDHI Clamp-O-Tron Docking Port with Parachute
		#autoLOC_SDHI_ParaDock_partDescription = A standard Clamp-O-Tron docking port with docking illumination lights, drogue and main parachutes integrated inside an aerodynamic housing. SDHI acquired the licence to manufacture their own copies of the venerable docking port, reportedly after being unimpressed by the original manufacturer's amateurish attempts to add parachutes to their flagship product.

		#autoLOC_SDHI_Service_Module_partName = SDHI Service Module
		#autoLOC_SDHI_Service_Module_partDescription = Designed for use with Kerlington's Mk1-3 Command Pod, this services and propulsion module is ideal for extended standalone operations in Low Kerbin Orbit, as a crew ferry to and from space stations, or short trips to the Mun and Minimus with the use of the client's own transfer stage. The unit comes with a built-in Fuel+Oxidizer variant of the venerable O-10 "Puff" rocket engine, a decoupler compatible with the SDHI 2.5m Heat Shield, ample surface area to attach RCS thrusters/communications antennae/PV Solar Arrays, integrated reaction wheels and advanced stablizer avionics, as well as an integrated fuel cell assembly to generate electricity in the absence of sunlight. Free carton of roasted peanuts included with every purchase.
