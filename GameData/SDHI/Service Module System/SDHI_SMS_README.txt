 - SDHI Heat Shield characteristics updated for KSP 1.0.5's thermal model
 - Side fairings and Mk1-2 Pod Aeroshroud colliders reworked using convex rather than concave meshes
 - Side fairings now decouple from the Service Module itself rather than the Service Module Adapter
 - The Service Module and Avionics Ring now have built-in support for MechJeb and RemoteTech
 - The Service Module and Avionics Ring decoupler will wait until the umbilical has fully extended before releasing the Mk1-2 Pod

Bugs/Known Issues
 - Part testing contracts are generated in Career Mode
    - This not intended behaviour, since the SDHI SMS is intended to be tested as a complete assembled stack rather than in piecemeal
    - A future update might include a proper contract for testing the SDHI SMS


3.0.1 - 10 July 2015
---------------------------

Changes / Fixes:

    - Both values are comparable to stock parachute part performance
    - Note: RealChute is still the recommended default

Bugs/Known Issues
 - Mk 1-2 Pod Umbilical Port is now also toggleable outside of the VAB/SPH editor scenes
    - This is due to a limitation with the current stock KSP ModuleAnimateGeneric behaviour, but is not game-breaking.
 - Part testing contracts are generated in Career Mode
    - This not intended behaviour, since the SDHI SMS is intended to be tested as a complete assembled stack rather than in piecemeal
    - A future update might include a proper contract for testing the SDHI SMS

 - The Service Module Adapter textures have been reworked to be visually consistent with the Service Module upper ring itself
 - The Pod Boost Protective Cover and Service Module Fairings are now fully compatible with the new stock aerodynamics system
    - This requires the latest version of the AnimatedDecouplers plugin, which provides special versions of the standard decoupler/jettison PartModules in order for the stock ModuleCargoBay to know when to update its drag occlusion behaviour
 - Removed Ferram Aerospace Research MM patch for Pod Boost Protect Cover
    - The latest versions of FAR now intrinsically and automatically handle drag occlusion for hollow parts, making such patches redundant
 - Fixed HotRockets! MM patch for the fairingless LV-909 engine

Bugs/Known Issues

    - The problem generally occurs when angle snap is enabled, possibly due to editor scene changes in KSP 0.90.0
    - No known fix
 - Part testing contracts are generated in Career Mode
    - This not intended behaviour, since the SDHI SMS is intended to be tested as a complete assembled stack rather than in piecemeal

    - IACBM fins, Boost Protect Cover hatch and Mk 1-2 Pod Umbilical Port remain toggleable in the VAB/SPH editor scenes
    - Firespitter plugin is no longer required, and has been dropped from the list of dependencies
 - Added fallback patch for stock parachute behaviour if RealChute is absent
    - Note: RealChute is still the recommended default
    - Stock parachute behaviour only deploys main chutes, and should only be used in an emergency as it may cause sudden or craft-damaging deacceleration upon deployment  

Bugs/Known Issues
 - Mk 1-2 Pod Umbilical Port is now also toggleable outside of the VAB/SPH editor scenes
    - This is due to a limitation with the current stock KSP ModuleAnimateGeneric behaviour, but is not game-breaking.

2.2          29 August 2014
---------------------------

Changes / Fixes:
 - Added Node Resizer support
    - This dynamically changes the stack nodes of the Avionics Ring and Heat Shield to size 0 while in the VAB/SPH editor scenes, allowing for easier attachment (and thus fixing the "bouncing" attachment node bug)
    - When entering the flight scene, this automatically switches the node size back to 2 to ensure a strong structural connection as usual
 - New meshes, graphics and better details for the FusTek Karmony hatch on the IACBM parachute-equipped docking port
    - This is for compatibility / visual consistency with future versions of FusTek Station Parts

1.6          24 December 2013
---------------------------

Changes / Fixes:
 - Added new 0.23 EFFECTS{} for parachute sounds (stupid_chris)

---------------------------

Changes / Fixes:
 - Compatibility upgrade to take advantage of new features in RealChute v0.3
    - Parachute drag is now dependent on effective canopy area rather than stock drag

---------------------------

Changes / Fixes:
 - Parachute-equipped docking ports now use stupid_chris's RealChute Parachute Systems plugin
    - Drogues will now auto-cut properly before automatically deploying the main chutes
    - Docking port lights can now be toggled normally during parachute deployment

1.3          8 November 2013
---------------------------

Features:
 - New Part
    - SDHI 2.5m Avionics Ring
 - Avionics Ring is essentially the upper decoupler portion of the full Service Module, with a bonus battery, reaction wheel and toggleable integrated fuel-to-electricity converter
    - This is particularly useful for people who want to build their own Service Module, but also use the SDHI Heat Shield and Boost Protective Cover 


1.2          25 October 2013
---------------------------

Changes:
 - VAB/SPH: Moved SDHI 2.5m Service Module Adapter and SDHI 2.5m Service Module Fairing to Aero tab

1.0          12 October 2013
---------------------------

Features:
 - Initial release
 - New parts
    - SDHI Mk1-2 Pod Boost Protective Cover
    - Clamp-O-Tron Docking Port - Parachute version
    - IACBM 1.25m - Parachute version
    - SDHI 2.5m Heat Shield
    - SDHI 2.5m Service Module
    - LV-909 Liquid Fuel Engine (Fairingless)
    - SDHI 2.5m Service Module Fairing
    - SDHI 2.5m Service Module Adapter
 - Boost Protective Cover is ogive-shaped to fit stock Mk1-2 Pod and any surface-attached accessories underneath
    - Staging activates both the shroud decoupler and jettison solid rocket motors
    - If shroud jettison is to be triggered via action groups, both the decoupler and the solid motors must be manually mapped to the same action key
 - Docking Ports come with short-range illumination lamps and integrated drogue/main parachute system
    - Clamp-O-Tron variant is compatible with stock standard-sized docking ports
    - IACBM variant is compatible with the FusTek Station Parts Expansion add-on
 - Service Module comes with:
    - Non-staged CM-SM decoupler to prevent accidental Pod/Service Module seperation during flight (action groups or right-click context menu used instead)
    - Toggleable integrated fuel-to-electricity converter for use


Bugs/Known Issues
 - Drogue parachutes do not auto-cut until mains are fully deployed
    - This is due to the use of *two* ModuleParachutes, which is technically "hacky" by KSP standards
    - Unlike BobCat's Orion spacecraft, however, the parachute-equipped docking ports will use the greater of the two drag configurations, guaranteeing a safe landing
        - Warranty void if parachutes are deployed on a planetary body other than Kerbin
 - Docking Port Lights become untoggleable after parachute deployment
    - This is because of the way KSP handles animations; the game can only save the state of one animation at a time, and the docking ports need several animations to handle the various parachute deployment stages and the lights.
